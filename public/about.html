<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Arian Noor. I am a current engineer at Samsung. I graduated from
  Texas A&M University in 2022. I have been working at Samsung for a little over 2 years.
  In my free time, I like going to the gym and playing sports. I love playing soccer in particular.
  For 2025, my goals are to watch what I eat, be consistent in the gym, and become less of a consumer
  and more a producer.
